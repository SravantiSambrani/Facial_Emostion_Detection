My machine learning project
A real time facial emotions detection using deep learning concepts like CNN, machine learning algorithms like SVM, Decision tree classification, etc.
This model detects facial emotions in live with accuracy 84%.
Emotions like Happy, Sad, Fear, Surprise, Disgust, Neutral can be observed.

Facial Emotion Detection Project
Overview
This project focuses on building a Facial Emotion Detection system that identifies human emotions based on facial expressions using deep learning techniques. The model is built using Keras and TensorFlow frameworks, and it can classify emotions into seven categories: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise.

The system processes images from a webcam or static pictures to detect and classify emotions in real-time. It uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract features from grayscale images, followed by dense layers to predict the emotional state.

Project Structure
Training Data: Facial images for each emotion, organized in the data/train/ and data/test/ directories.
Model Architecture: A Sequential CNN model with convolutional layers for feature extraction and dense layers for emotion classification.
Real-Time Detection: A script that uses OpenCV to capture live video feed and detect faces and their corresponding emotions.
Libraries Used
Keras: For building and training the deep learning model.
TensorFlow: Backend for model training.
OpenCV: For face detection and real-time webcam input.
NumPy: For array manipulation and image processing.
SciPy: Miscellaneous utilities for image operations.
Dataset
The dataset contains images for training and testing, each labeled with one of the seven emotions. The ImageDataGenerator from Keras is used for data augmentation, which helps the model generalize better by applying transformations like rotation, zoom, and horizontal flips.

Model Architecture
The CNN model consists of the following layers:

Convolutional Layers: To extract features from the input images.
Max Pooling Layers: For down-sampling the feature maps.
Dropout Layers: To prevent overfitting during training.
Fully Connected (Dense) Layers: To combine features and predict the emotion class.
Output Layer: A softmax layer to output the probability distribution over the seven emotion classes.
Model Summary:
Input: Grayscale images of size 48x48 pixels.
Convolutional Layers: 32, 64, 128, 256 filters, kernel size (3x3).
Pooling Layers: 2x2 pooling windows.
Dropout: Applied after convolutional layers and dense layers to prevent overfitting.
Dense Layers: Flattened output is passed through fully connected layers with 512 neurons and ReLU activation.
The model is trained using the Adam optimizer, with categorical cross-entropy loss, and the softmax function for multi-class classification.

Training Process
Data Augmentation:
Rescaling pixel values (1/255) to normalize the input.
Rotations, zooming, and horizontal flipping to increase dataset variety.
Model Training:
The model is trained for 30 epochs with a batch size of 32.
Real-time progress is evaluated using a validation dataset.
The model is then saved as model_file.h5 for later use in real-time emotion detection.
Real-Time Emotion Detection
For real-time emotion detection:

The system uses OpenCV to capture video from the webcam.
The Haar Cascade Classifier is used to detect faces in the frame.
Detected faces are resized to 48x48 pixels, normalized, and passed through the trained model for emotion classification.
The detected emotion is displayed on the screen along with a bounding box around the face.

Future Improvements
Enhance the dataset with more diverse samples to increase accuracy.
Implement further optimizations like Transfer Learning to improve performance on smaller datasets.
Integrate this system with mobile or web-based applications for wider use.
Conclusion
The Facial Emotion Detection project is a powerful application of deep learning and computer vision. It demonstrates how CNNs can be applied to classify human emotions based on facial expressions, offering poten.
